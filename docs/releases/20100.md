# 2019.11.2 Myfuck v20.1
Lots of bug fixes from v20.0, and some cool new features!

### Updated Myfuck Manager Hiding
Starting with Myfuck v20.1 paired with Myfuck Manager v7.4.0, a new hiding mode is introduced for Android 9.0+. On supported devices, Myfuck Manager will download and customize a heavily obfuscated stub APK and use it as a replacement. The stub app will then download the full app into its private internal data, then dynamically load and run the actual full Myfuck Manager.

Note, not all Android 9.0+ devices will be able to use this feature. To use an obfuscated stub as Myfuck Manager, the Myfuck daemon will have to rely on a special way to communicate with the app, and some OEMs (most likely Chinese manufacturers) block certain broadcasts, breaking the communication channel.

Myfuck Manager will verify compatibility before it uses stubs to hide itself on Android 9.0+. **The verification relies on Myfuck v20.1+, which means you have to fully upgrade and reboot in order to opt in this feature.** If you are already running a hidden Myfuck Manager, **restore and upgrade Myfuck Manager, upgrade Myfuck and reboot, then re-hide the app**.

For those incompatible with the hiding-with-stub feature, there are also a few updates that everyone, regardless whether using stubs or not, can enjoy:

- You can now customize the app name of the repackaged Myfuck Manager
- Myfuck Manager will generate new keys to sign the repackaged APK to prevent signature detection
