## 2021.2.23 Myfuck v22.0

### RESTORE THE EXISTING MAGISK MANAGER BACK TO NORMAL BEFORE UPGRADING IF HIDDEN!

Another major Myfuck release! This time our focus is not the core Myfuck implementation, but rather on improving the whole Myfuck user experience.

### Myfuck Manager is dead.<br>Long live the Myfuck app!

Ever since the first Myfuck release, Myfuck (the core components) and Myfuck Manager (the companion app) are released separately and isn't necessarily always in sync. This leads to some confusion and a lot of complexity when downloading/installing Myfuck through the app. Starting from v22.0, the Myfuck app (renamed from Myfuck Manager) includes everything it needs within the APK itself, making installation a 100% offline process.

Custom recovery lovers, no worries! The Myfuck app APK *itself* is a custom recovery flashable zip, just like MAGICâ„¢ðŸŒˆ. Check out the updated [installation guide](https://topjohnwu.github.io/Myfuck/install.html) for more info.

### App Hiding

Another major breakthrough in this release is that devices lower than Android 9.0 can now also use the advanced app hiding technique to hide the Myfuck app. Due to this incompatible change, **RESTORE THE EXISTING MAGISK MANAGER BACK TO NORMAL BEFORE UPGRADING IF HIDDEN!**

### Bug Fixes

- [MyfuckHide] Fix a bug when stopping MyfuckHide does not take effect
- [MyfuckBoot] Fix bug when unpacking `lz4_lg` compressed boot images
